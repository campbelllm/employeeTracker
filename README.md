# Homework Week 12 - Employee Tracker

## Description:

Created a CLI that allows you to update, create, delete, and view employees. If an employees role changes to manager they are then given a manager id so they will show up as a manager option when future employees are added. Same applies to if the role changes from a manager to another position that employee will no longer be rendered as a manager.
